Multi-Agent Pacman

Subject: Adversarial agents

All agents algorithms can be found in the "multiAgents.py" file.

1. Reflex Agent: A reflex agent chooses an action at each choice point by examining its alternatives via a state evaluation function. 
It only considers immediate results.

2. MinMax Agent: Implements the MinMax algorithm for a given state evaluation function and depth parameter.

3. AlphaBeta Agent: Implements the AlphaBeta algorithm (improved MinMax which avoids running through unecessary nodes) for a given state 
evaluation function and depth parameter.

4. EspectiMax Agent: Implements the MinMax algorithm (MinMax which contains random nodes) for a given state evaluation function and 
depth parameter.

5. Better evaluation function: developed heuristic to improve the agents performance.
