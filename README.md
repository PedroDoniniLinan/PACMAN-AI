# PACMAN-AI
Several AI mini-projects with Pacman. Each one treats a different class of algorithms. The content of each project is explained in its respective "_content.md". These projects are UC Berkeley's AI exercises and were used as one of my graduation courses' projects. The
algorithms specified in the description files were developed by me.

To run the algorithms:
1. Open command-line terminal;
2. Go to the desired mini-project directory;
3. Type the desired test command (described in each project's "_content.md" file).
